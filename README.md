Getting Started
Ready to set up PHAROS-BOT? Just follow these straightforward steps:
1. Clone the Repository
First, grab the code by cloning this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/Warhuairdrop/PHAROS-BOT.git

2. Install Dependencies
Next, navigate into the PHAROS-BOT directory and install all the necessary Node.js packages:
cd PHAROS-BOT
npm install

3. Create Your .env File
PHAROS-BOT uses environment variables for secure configuration. Create a file named .env in the root of your PHAROS-BOT directory. This is where you'll store sensitive information like API keys and private keys.
Here's an example of what your .env file should look like:
PRIVATE_KEY_1=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE_1
PRIVATE_KEY_2=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE_2
# Add more private keys as needed (e.g., PRIVATE_KEY_3=...)
# You can also add other necessary environment variables here (e.g., API keys for specific services)

Important Security Notes for Private Keys:
 * Your private keys are sensitive! Never, ever share your .env file or your private keys with anyone.
 * Feel free to rename PRIVATE_KEY_1, PRIVATE_KEY_2, etc., to something more descriptive like ETHEREUM_WALLET_KEY or SOLANA_WALLET_KEY if it helps you manage them. Just remember to update your script to use the new variable names.
 * In your pharos_bot.js script, you can easily access these private keys using process.env.PRIVATE_KEY_1, process.env.PRIVATE_KEY_2, and so on.
Running the Script
Once you've got your dependencies installed and your .env file configured, running PHAROS-BOT is a breeze:
node pharos_bot.js

That's it! Your script should now be running and automating your defined tasks.
